#Developed by Jansen Pimentel
# 
#This mod spawns the player with a leg wound. The user must complete the level before bleeding out while fighting monsters on the way.
#
#The user can:
#	-sprint by holding right-click as you move.
#	-double jump by pressing the space bar twice.
#	-pick up health packs that give a health regeneration powerup.
#	-pick up weapons that give a fire rate boost powerup.
#	-pick up ammo that give a damage boost powerup.
#
#Speedrun rules:
#	-you lose health over time due to your leg wound.
#	-you lose health when jumping due to your leg wound.
#	-your legs are unstable, making it impossible to stand still.
#	-a HUD demonstrating your mind is bouncing to show your health is below max.
#	-a HUD that will turn red when you're attacked.
#	-the HUD will fade away when you are close to death, so the player can see clearer.
#	-a ghost of you're your farthest run will appear after your first run.
